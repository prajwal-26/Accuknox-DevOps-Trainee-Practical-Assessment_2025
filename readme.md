 - Containerisation and Deployment of Wisecow Application on Kubernetes

I containerized the application using Docker and deployed it on Amazon EKS with Kubernetes manifests for deployment, service, ingress, and a self-signed TLS certificate. The application is exposed via a Classic Load Balancer (CLB) with HTTPS enabled. I set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate build and deployment, with screenshots showing successful execution.

Additionally, I applied KubeArmor policies to enforce access restrictions on sensitive paths, ensuring pod-level security. All manifests, policies, and scripts are included in the repo for review.
